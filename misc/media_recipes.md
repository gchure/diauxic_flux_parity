# Media Recipes

The composition of the base media and supplements 
used in this work are given below. 


## N-C- Buffer Base
Below is the growth-supporting concentrations of the components of the basic N-C-
buffer system. These are the final concentrations per batch of growth medium. A 
4X stock is typically prepared and stored at room temperature and diluted as needed. 

| **Chemical Species** | **Final Concentration [mM] ** | 
|:--:|:--:|
|K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> | 5.7 | 
|K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> | 77.5|
|KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> | 34.5|
|MgSO<sub>4</sub> | 0.4|
|NaCl | 43.1 |


To make a functional N-C- growth medium, the following components are added to 
the noted concentration:

|**Chemical Species** | **Final Concentration [mM]**|
|:--:|:--:|
|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl |  10  |
|Organic Acid or Sugar | Variable |
| Micronutrients | Variable |

## Micronutrients
Below is the final growth supporting concentrations of trace elements in all 
growth conditions. This is typically stored as a 1000X stock and kept at 4° C
and diluted as necessary. 

|**Chemical Species** | **Final Concentration µM** |
| :--: | :--: |
| (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>| 0.15 |
|H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> | 20 | 
|CoCl<sub>2</sub> | 1.5 |
|CuSO<sub>4</sub> | 0.5 |
|MnCl<sub>2</sub> | 4  | 
|ZnSO<sub>4</sub>| 0.5 |

## Carbon Concentrations
For notational simplicity, the various growth media used in this work have 
shorthand names, usually denoting the species or concentrations of different 
carbon sources or inducer concentrations. Below lists the make up of each growth 
medium used in this work. Note that "N-C-" corresponds to the N-C- buffer 
base as described above.

| **Growth Medium Shorthand** | **Growth Medium Composition** |
|:--:|:--:|
| glucose | N-C- + 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl +  10 mM glucose  + micronutrients|
| acetate | N-C- + 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 30 mM acetate  + micronutrients| 
| proline | N-C- + 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 12 mM L-proline + micronutrients | 
| ga_preshift | N-C- + 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 10 mM glucose + 30 mM acetate + micronutrients|
| ga_shift | N-C- + 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 0.6 mM glucose + 30 mM acetate + micronutrients |
